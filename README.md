# ATM-Machine
Replicates an ATM machine with the option to deposit and withdraw.

The basics of the code was provided to me by my MIT course. I added all the styling in CSS, as well as decisions around the design of th app. I chose to clear fields upon completion of a transaction, keeping track of the history of transactions, creating a drop down menu for the client to choose the type of bill they want for their withdrawal, and having the input field placeholder and submit button change wording depending on wether the deposit or withdrawal button were clicked. I wrote all of the code related to those parts of the app.
